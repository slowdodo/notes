Wireshark uses color-coding to highlight different types of traffic in the packet list pane and in the packet details pane. These color rules are defined in the Wireshark preferences and can be customized to suit your needs.

By default, Wireshark includes a number of predefined color rules that are applied to specific types of traffic. Some examples of these color rules are:

* Red: TCP packets that are marked as urgent or have a RST (reset) flag set
* Orange: TCP packets that have a FIN (finish) flag set
* Yellow: TCP packets with a SYN (synchronize) flag set
* Green: TCP packets with an ACK (acknowledge) flag set
* Blue: ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets
* Purple: DNS (Domain Name System) packets
* Pink: Packets that have been marked as suspicious by Wireshark's heuristics
* You can view and edit these color rules by going to the "View" menu and selecting "Coloring Rules". This will open the coloring rules editor, where you can add, delete, or modify existing color rules.
