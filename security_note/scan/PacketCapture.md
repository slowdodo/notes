Monitor mode: Sniffing the packets in the air without connecting (associating) with any access point.

Think of it like listening to people's conversations while you walk down the street.

Promiscuous mode: Sniffing the packets after connecting to an access point. 

This is possible because the wireless-enabled devices send the data in the air but only "mark" them to be processed by the intended receiver. 

They cannot send the packets and make sure they only reach a specific device, unlike with switched LANs.

Think of it like joining a group of people in a conversation, but at the same time being able to hear when someone says "Hey, Mike, I have a new laptop".
Even though you're not Mike, and that sentence was intended to be heard by Mike, but you're still able to hear it.
