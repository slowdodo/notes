Orchestration is the process of automating the management, deployment, and operation of application components. This includes tasks such as scheduling, resource allocation, and deployment of applications across a cluster. Docker is a popular tool for container orchestration, which allows developers to package their applications and dependencies into portable containers that can run on any infrastructure.
