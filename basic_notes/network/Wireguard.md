# wireguard
WireGuard is a free and open-source software application and communication protocol that implements virtual private network (VPN) techniques to create secure point-to-point connections in routed or bridged configurations. It was designed to be easy to use, lightweight, and fast.

One security advantage of WireGuard is that it uses modern cryptography and has a smaller codebase compared to other VPN protocols, which makes it easier to audit and less prone to security vulnerabilities. WireGuard also uses a simpler handshake process and does not require complex negotiation between the client and server, which makes it more efficient and less resource-intensive.

Wireguard is a fast, modern, and secure VPN tunnel. It operates at the network layer (layer 3 of the OSI model) and uses state-of-the-art cryptography to secure all communications between clients. One of the main advantages of Wireguard is its simplicity: it has a much smaller codebase and is easier to audit than other VPN protocols, which makes it less prone to security vulnerabilities. In addition, Wireguard has good performance and can be easily implemented on various platforms, including Linux, iOS, and Android.
