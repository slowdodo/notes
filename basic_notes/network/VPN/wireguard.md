WireGuard and IPSec are two different VPN protocols. The fundamental difference between the two protocols is as follows:

Stability: IPSec has been around for a long time and is therefore considered to be stable. On the other hand, WireGuard is a newer protocol and may not be as stable.

Speed: WireGuard is faster and uses fewer resources than IPSec. On the other hand, IPSec uses complex algorithms for security purposes, which can slow down the VPN connection.

Compatibility: IPSec is supported by a wider range of devices and platforms than WireGuard. This means that you may be able to use IPSec with more devices, but it also means that IPSec may be more complex to set up. WireGuard, on the other hand, is designed to be easy to set up and use.

Overall, the choice between WireGuard and IPSec will depend on your specific needs and requirements. WireGuard may be a good option if you want a fast and lightweight VPN protocol, while IPSec may be a better choice if you need a more stable and widely compatible VPN protocol.
