
X.500 is a standard for directory services in computer networks. It is part of the X.500 series of standards for the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). X.500 directories provide a way to store information about network resources, such as users, computers, and other devices, in a hierarchical structure. This information can be accessed and used by various applications and services within the network. X.500 directories are often used in conjunction with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to provide directory services over the Internet.
