# GARP(Global ARP)
GARP stands for the Generic Attribute Registration Protocol. It is a protocol used in networks to dynamically register and de-register attributes associated with a particular interface or device.

GARP allows devices on a network to advertise their attributes to other devices, and to receive updates when the attributes of other devices change. This allows devices to dynamically discover and communicate with each other, and to adapt to changes in the network environment.

GARP is used in various networking technologies, including VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) tagging, GVRP (GARP VLAN Registration Protocol), and MVRP (Multiple VLAN Registration Protocol). It is a key component of the IEEE 802.1Q standard for VLAN tagging.
